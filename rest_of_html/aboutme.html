				<p id="yellow">I was born in India where I spent the first three years of my life. Although I don't remember much from my time there, it is the place where my family background originates from. My country of origin is what has given me my sense of identity throughout my life.</p>
				<br>
				<p id="yellow">I came to the United States with my parents when I was three. I am thankful for this, since living in New York City has opened me up to countless opportunities and has enabled me to meet people of many different backgrounds.</p>
				<br>
				<p id="yellow">While growing up I gradually developed an interest in the math and science fields. I became better at thinking analytically as well as determining how to use my knowledge of a situation to solve problems.</p>
				<br>
				<p id="yellow">Presently, I am an honors student pursuing an undergraduate degree in computer engineering at the Grove School of Engineering in New York City. I am passionate about the direction I want to go in the future, and am working to attain the skills I need to succeed. Throughout my years at CCNY I have worked on numerous projects that showcase my ability to develop useful tools that could be used in day-to-day life, and am currently involved in making more.</p>
				<br>
				<p id="yellow">Upon graduation I intend to specialize in web development, working on either the front-end or back-end side of user applications.</p>
