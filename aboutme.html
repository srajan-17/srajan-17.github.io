				<p id="yellow">I was born in India where I spent the first three years of my life. Although I don't remember much from my time there, it is the place where my family background originates from.</p>
				<p id="yellow">I came to the United States with my parents when I was three. I am thankful for this, since living in New York City has opened me up to countless opportunities and has enabled me to meet people of many different backgrounds.</p>
				<p id="yellow">While growing up I gradually developed an interest in the math and science fields. I became better at thinking analytically as well as determining how to use my knowledge of a situation to solve problems.</p>
				<p id="yellow">Presently, I am an honors student pursuing an undergraduate degree in computer engineering at the City College of New York. I am passionate about the field I want to go into in the future, and am working to attain the skills I need to advance in it. Throughout my years at CCNY I have worked on numerous projects that showcase my ability to develop useful tools that could be used in day-to-day life, and am currently involved in making more.</p>
